What is this?
---------------------------------------

This is a light framework that interfaces with gallery to read art-root files. This tool serves as a 2D event display for McroBooNE data and MC.

---------------------------------------
Requirements
---------------------------------------

1) You need gallery.  For right now, that requires ups products, which means it uses it's own gcc/python/root and not the ones on your laptop.  If you are on the gpvms, getting gallery is super simple.  On your laptop, visit scisoft.fnal.gov to get gallery.

2) You need larsoft data products: nusimdata, larcoreobj, lardataobj.  If you get gallery via ups, get these via ups too.

3) We're working on a way to build gallery and larsoftobj systems without ups, using your own gcc and such.  This will come out later.

4) If you want to have the display (when it's ready) you'll need numpy and PyQt.  You can get numpy and qt5 through scisoft and ups as well.  PyQt5 you can install once qt5 is built and ready, just make sure to install it to the ups python area.
